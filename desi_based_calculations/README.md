The code and notebook(s) rely substantially on the DESI code base and specifically on DESIMODEL (with its associateed dependency on DESIUTIL).

DESIMODEL is currently at release version 0.9.6 (Jul 2018): 
- requirements installed via the following: pip install -r requirements.txt
- code installed via the following: python setup.py install
(not updated to modern Python coding standards/package installation)
- doucmentation available through READTHEDOCS: https://desimodel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

DESIMODEL employs a variety of data, with the publicly accessible data being available through SVN: https://desi.lbl.gov/svn/code/desimodel (with the standard trunk, branches, tags 
sub-directories).

Current DESI processed data is served via NERSC.

However, publicly available data is available through NOIRLab-DataLab (https://datalab.noirlab.edu/desi/index.php)
