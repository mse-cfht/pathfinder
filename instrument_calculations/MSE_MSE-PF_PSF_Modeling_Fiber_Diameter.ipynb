    "# Prior PSF Modeling Efforts for MSE\n",
    "The initial effort to model the PSF for the proposed MSE instrument and in attendant fashion perform the fiber diameter optimization was done by A. McConnachie and others in 2014 and 2015.  The analysis employed information from the studies of R. Racine and J.-C. Cullaindre as well as the IMAKA Feasibility Report.  In addition, data from the MegaCam/MegaPrime instrument was utilized.
